Context: SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of US$ 62 million; other providers cost upward of US$ 165 million each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if I can determine if the first stage will land I would have valuable data to determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

Goal: I will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
